# Introduction


This tutorial is part of the pre-course materials of a "Short Course on Epidemics Analysis". The aim is to introduce students to the very basic concepts of R and R Studio, in order to get some baseline knowledge in R and R programming. 


# Installing R and R Studio

_R_ is a free software environment and _RStudio_ is a free and open-source environment for to work on R. Both, R and Rstuido should be installed separately. 

_R_ can be installed from the R Project for Statistical computing website: 
https://r-project.org/

_RStudio_ can be installed from its website. The _free_ version is sufficient to conduct the routine epidemiological analyses  
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Once both are installed, we work from  _RStudio_.

For a very detailed explanation on how to install R and R Studio, please visit the video made by Thibaut Jombart from RECON

# Structures in R

According to Hadley Wickham, in his Advanced R book [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/], there are two types of structures in R:

- Homogeneous: atomic vectors (1d), matrices (2d) and arrays (nd) 

- Heterogeneous: dataframes and lists 



### Atomic vectors

These are the most basic structures in R and have only one dimension (1d):

- a. Double (numeric)

- b. Logic

- c. Character

- d. Integer


```{r}

vector_double <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)  

vector_logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

vector_character <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")

vector_integer <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L)

```


To evaluate which type of vector we have, we can use two commands *typeof* 

```{r}
typeof(vector_double)
typeof(vector_logic)
typeof(vector_character)
typeof(vector_integer)

```


### Matrices

Matrices are structures a bit more complex than vectors, with two main characteristics:

- A matrix is composed of only one type of vector

- A matrix has only one dimension

A command to build a *matrix* uses three arguments: 

- *data* corresponds to the list of vectors we want to use in the matrix

- *nrow* the number of rows where the data is gonna be split (first dimension)

- *ncol*  the number of columns where the data is gonna be split (second dimension)

By default the matrix is filled by column, unless we specify otherwise using *byrow = TRUE*

```{r}

matrix_of_doub <-  matrix(data = vector_double, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
matrix_of_doub

matrix_of_log <-  matrix(data = vector_logic, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
matrix_of_log

matrix_of_char <-  matrix(data = vector_character, nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
matrix_of_char

matrix_of_int <-  matrix(data = vector_integer, nrow = 4, ncol = 5)
matrix_of_int


dim(matrix_of_int)

```



### Arrays

Array is a special type of matrix, where there is more than two dimensions (n dimensions).

An array of two dimensions is a matrix\

To create an array we need three arguments: *data* and *dim*.

In turn, the *dim* argument of an array is composed of three arguments being: 1) number of rows, 2) number of columns and 3) number of dimensions.



```{r}

vector_example <-1:18
array_example <- array(data = vector_example, dim = c(2,3,3))

dim(array_example)
array_example

```



### Dataframes

A *dataframe* is a heterogeneous and bidimensional structure, similar but not exactly equal to a matrix. Unlike a matrix, various types of vectors can be part of a single dataframe.

The arguments for the *data.frame* command are simply the columns in the dataframe. Each column shoud have the same number of rows to bea able to fit into a daraframe.

Data frames do not allow vectors with different lengths. When the length of the vector is smaller than the length of the data frame, the data frame coerces the vector to its length.

```{r}


data_example <- data.frame( vector_character,vector_double, vector_logic, vector_integer)

```

To access the general structure of a dataframe we use the command *str* 

```{r}

str(data_example)

```


To access the different components of the dataframe we use this syntax *[,]* where the first dimension corresponds to rows and the second dimension to columns.

```{r}

data_example[1,2]

```



### List

A *list* is the most complex structure in base R. A list cab be composed of any type of other structures of any dimension.

```{r}

list_example <- list(vector_character,
                     matrix_of_int,
                     data_example)

```


To access the different components of a list, we use the syntax *[]* where the argument is simply the order within the list.

```{r}

list_example[1]

```




# Functions

A function is one of the structures that makes *R* a very powerful platform for programming. 

There are varios types of functions

- *Primitive or base functions*: these are the default functions in _R_ under the _base_ package. For instance, for basic arithmentic operations such as addition _sum_, substraction _*_, multiplication _*_, but also for more complex operations such as extraction of median values _median_, or even more complex like _summary_ of a variable.

- *Functions from packages*: these are functions created within a package. For example the function *glm* in the *stats* package.


- *User-built functions*: these are the functions that any user creates for a customised routine. In turn, these functions could become part of a package.


The basic components of a function are:


- __*name*:__ this is the name that we give to our function (for example: _myfun_)

- __*formals or arguments*:__ these are the series of elements that control how to call the funciton.

- __*body*:__ this is the seires of operarions or modifications on my argumnets.

- __*output*:__ This is the results after mofifying the arguments. If this output corresponds to a series of data we can extract it using the command _return_.

- __*function internal environment*:__ means the specific rules and obnjects within a function. Those rules and objects will not work outside the function. 


##### User-built function (example 1)

Let's build a function that calculates our Body Mass Index (BMI)


```{r}

# The name (myfun)
myfun <- function(weight, 
                  height) # The arguments (weight and heighj)
{ 
  # The body
  
  BMI      <- weight/(height^2)
  
  return(BMI) # Retun specification for the output
}


formals(myfun)
body(myfun)
environment(myfun)

myfun(weight = 88, height = 1.78)



```





##### User-built function (example 2)

Let's build a function that has default values, in this case we don't need to specify always some of the arguments as they can be set as by default.


```{r}

# The name (myfun2)
myfun2 <- function(weight, 
                   height,
                   units = 'kg/m2') # The arguments (weight and height)
{ 
  # The body
  BMI      <- weight/(height^2)
  output <- paste(round(BMI,1), units)
  
  return(output) # Retun specification for the output
}


myfun2(weight = 88, height = 1.78)


myfun2(weight = 8800, height = 178, units = 'g/cm2')

```

# R packages

As described by Hadley Wilkham in his book *R packages*, a package is the fundamental unit of reproducible R code. A package should include at least:

- Reusable R functions
- Documentation
- Sample data 

Any R user could build a package that then can be used or modified by others as they are open-source.

The R packages are available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) https://cran.r-project.org

The basic commands to basic use of packages

1. Install a package with the command _install.packages ("package-name")_
2. Use them in R with _library ("package-name")_


Let's install one of the packages from RECON.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('incidence')
library(incidence)

```

Library is a directory containing installed packages. We can use _ lapply(.libPaths(), dir)_ to check which packages are active currently in our R session. 

An important part of a package is the documentation. This is stored in the _vignettes_. To access the basic documentation on a package we can use _browseVignettes("incidence")_



# Scoping and Environments

Wen we create a function, a new environment is created. This is important because within a function R look for the elements  within the function but if the element doesn't exist within the function then R looks for it in the global environment.

#### Example of a function which objects are only avalible in th eglobal environment

```{r}
mynewfun <- function () {
  z = x + y 
  return(z)
  
}

x = 1
y = 3

mynewfun()

```



# Some of the most used functions in R

## Distributions

All distributions in R can be explored by the use of functions that allow us to get the different forms of a distribution. For example for a normal distribution

To explore the arguments in a function we use _?dnorm_

- _dnorm_ = density function with default arguments _(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)_
_ _pnorm_ gives the distribution function
- _qnorm_  gives the quantile function
- _rnorm_  generates random deviates

Many other distributions are part of the package *stats* with comes by default with R such as: uniform, poisson, binomial. 

For other less used distributions sometimes other packages.




#### Example of a function which objects are defined partically in the local environment and in the global envoronment

```{r}
mynewfun <- function (xx) {
  zz = xx + yy 
  return(zz)
  
}

yy = 4
mynewfun(xx = 4)

```

This characteristic of R is very important when running any analysis or routine. It is always recommended NOT to use elements within a function that are only available in the global environment.



# Create and open datasets

R allows not only to open but also to create data sets. There are three sources of data sets:

- Data set imported as such (from Excel, csv, stata, or RDS formats, among others)

- Dataset that is part of a R package

- Dataset created in our R session

# Tidyverse

In order to better manage datasets, we recommend install and use _tidyverse_ package which authomatically upload many other packages that (dplyr, tidyr, tibble, readr, purr, among others) that are very useful for data wrangling.

```{r, echo = TRUE, include=TRUE, eval= TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

```



Let's open and explore a dataset that is imported from excel

For example this dataset from our RECON practical on early outbreak analysis:
- [PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx](static/data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-10-27.xlsx):

Then, lets save this dataset in the same directory we are currently working.

For importing datasets from excel we can use the library _readxl_ which is linked to tidyverse. However to will still need to load the _readxl_ library as it is not a core tidyverse package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
dat <- read_excel("PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx")

```

	
```{r include = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(here)
dat <- readxl::read_xlsx(here("static/data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx"))

```


Here, we will take a look at some of the most used functions from  *tidyverse* 

Here, we will be using a lot the pipe function _%>%_ which is key to use tidyverse and makes programming easier. The pipe function allows emphasise a sequence of actions on an object. 

From the package  *dyplr*, the most common functions are:

__glimpse__: allows a rapid exploration of a dataset

__arrange__: arranges the dataset by the value of a particular variable if numeric, or by alphabetic order if it is a character.

__mutate__: allows generate a new variable

__rename__: allows change a variable's name

__summarise__: reduces the dimension of a dataset 




```{r}
glimpse(dat)

dat %>% arrange (age)
dat %>% mutate (fecha_inicio_sintomas = onset)

dat %>% rename (edad = age)
glimpse(dat)

dat %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(number = n())

dat %>% filter(age >14)

select(dat, starts_with("date"))
select(dat, ends_with("loc"))

slice(dat, 10:15)
dat[10:15,]

filter(dat, sex == "female", age <= 30)

```

Let's open and explore a dataset that is part of a package


```{r, echo = TRUE, include=TRUE}
# install.packages("outbreaks")
library(outbreaks)
measles_dat <- outbreaks::measles_hagelloch_1861
class(measles_dat)
head(measles_dat)
tail(measles_dat)

```



From the package  *tidyr*, the most common functions are:

__gather__: makes wide data 
__spred__ : makes long data



```{r}

people <- tibble(
  birth_date = as.Date('2000-01-01') + 0:9,
  name = letters[1:10],
  Y = rnorm(10, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(10, 0, 4),
  gender = rep(c('f', 'm'), 5)
)  %>%
  mutate(age = as.Date('2019-06-01') -  birth_date)

glimpse(people)

people %>% spread(key = 'age', gender)




```




# ggplot2

GGplot is an implementation of the concept of *grammar of grapphics* that has been implemmented in R by Hadley Wikcham. He explains in his ggplot2 book that "the grammar is a mapping from data to aesthesic atributes (colour, shape, size) of geomethic objects (points, lines, bars)". 

The main components of a ggplot2 plot are:
- _data frame_ 

- _aesthesic mappings_ this reffers to the indications on how teh data should be mapped (x, y) to color, size, etc

_geoms_ reffers to geometric objects such as points, lines, shapes

_facets_  for condictional plors

_coodinate system_ 

### Basic functions in ggplot

_ggplo()_ is the core function in ggplot2. The basic argument of the function is the dataframe we want to plot _(data)_.

_ggplot(data)_ then can be associated using the simbol _+_ to other type of functions the __geoms_ that will  draw a particular type of shape. Some of the most commonly used are:

- _geompoints()_ : for points 

- _geomline()_   : for lines 

- _geombar()_    : for bar charts 

- _geomhistogram()_: for historgrams

All these commands wiil use the same sintax for the aesthesics _(x, y, colour, fill, shape)_. 

#### GGplot example with the measles dataset 

Let's use the measles dataset from the _outbreaks_ package that we had impoted above. In this case we want to make a graph that display a the time-series of cases by week coloured by gender, so we have to define that:

*x* = time

*y* = agregated number of cases by week and gender

*colour* = gender

An important thing to be aware is that for a single instruction in ggplot, it will only use variables that belong to the same dataset. So, we need to have the three variables (x, y and colour) in the same dataframe (with the same length). 


```{r}
head(measles_dat, 5)
```

In this case, we can notice that the measles dataset as it is now doesn't contain one of the three variables, the _y_ variable (agggregated number of cases per week, by gender). This means we first need to reformat the dataframe so that it actually contains the three variables we want to plot.

```{r}
head(measles_dat, 5)
```

To reformat the dataframe we can use various functions explained above from the _dplyr_ package.

```{r}

measles_grouped <- measles_dat %>% 
  mutate(cases = 1) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(gender))) %>%
  group_by(date_of_rash, gender) %>% summarise(cases = n())

head(measles_grouped, 5)


```

Once the data frame is ready, plotting is very easy

```{r}


ggplot(data = measles_grouped) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date_of_rash, y = cases, colour = gender))


  
   


```


#### Modifying the theme and defaults visualisation

By default  ggplot makes many decition for us, such as the colours used, the size of the lines, the font size, etc. Sometimes we may want to change them to improve the  visualisation.

Here there is an example of an alternative way to present the exact same data. You can try and mofify some of the lines in order to understand which is the effect of each of the instructions.

```{r}


p <- ggplot(data = measles_grouped, 
       aes(x = date_of_rash, y = cases, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat= 'identity', colour = 'black', alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap (~ gender, nrow = 2) +
  xlab ('Date of onset')   + ylab ('measles cases') +
  theme(strip.background = element_blank(),
        strip.text.x = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle('Measles Cases in Hagelloch (Germany) in 1861') +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.2))  +
    scale_fill_manual(values =c('purple', 'green')) 

p

```

Finally, ggplot has a very useful feature that allows you to simply add moficiations on top of a ggplot object. For instance, we decided we want to change the title and the colour of the gender variable after we have finished the plot. In this case, we don't have to make the plot again. We simply need to add the instruction on top of the previous plot


```{r}


p + ggtitle('another title') +
    scale_fill_manual(values =c('blue', 'lightblue')) 


```

# Further learning

In order to apply many of these basic concept to a particular case, I recommend to do the practical "An outbreak of gastroenteritis in Stegen, Germany" from the RECON learn webiste https://www.reconlearn.org/post/stegen.html
