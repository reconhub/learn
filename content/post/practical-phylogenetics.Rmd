This practical aims to illustrate the basics of **phylogenetic reconstruction**
using R, with an emphasis on how the methods work, how their results can be
interpreted, and the relative advantages and limitations of the methods.  Three
main classes of phylogenetic approaches are introduced, namely
**distance-based**, **maximum parsimony**, and **maximum
likelihood** methods.  We also illustrate how to assess the reliability of
individual nodes using bootstrap, and show how a simple linear model can be used
to estimate a molecular clock in rooted phylogenies.  Methods are illustrated
using a dataset of seasonal influenza isolates sampled in the US from 1993 to
2008.


# Introduction

## Phylogenetics in a nutshell

The reconstruction of evolutionary relationships of a set of organisms can be a
tricky task, and has led to the development of a variety of methods over the
last decades, implemented in an even larger number of software.  However, these
methods can be classified into three main categories:

- **distance-based methods**: compute a matrix of pairwise genetic distances
  between the studied taxa, and summarize it using a hierarchical clustering
  algorithm such as UPGMA or Neighbour-Joining. *Advantages*: fast (the fastest)
  and flexible (different genetic distances allow to account for different
  features of DNA sequence evolution). *Limitations*: no model comparison (can't
  test for the 'best' tree, or the 'best' model of evolution); may be inaccurate
  and highly dependent on the distance and clustering algorithm chosen.

- **maximum parsimony**: seeks the tree with the smallest number of overall
  genetic changes between the taxa. This is achieved by changing randomly the
  topology of the tree until parsimony is no longer improved. *Advantages*:
  intuitive interpretation (assumes that the simplest scenario is the most
  likely), usually accurate when the amount of genetic changes is
  small. *Limitations*: computer-intensive, simplistic model of evolution, no
  model comparison, inaccurate when substantial evolution takes place, and when
  heterogeneous mutation rates exist in different parts of the tree.

- **likelihood-based method**: based on a model of sequence evolution which
  allows to compute a likelihood, that is, the probability of observing the data
  given the model and a set of parameters. There are two main branches of
  likelihood-based methods: maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The first
  seeks the 'best' tree and parameter values, i.e. the one maximizing the
  likelihood. The second derives samples of trees and model parameters which are
  the most consistent with the data and possible prior knowledge about the
  tree/parameters. *Advantages*: flexible (any model of evolution can be used),
  usually accurate, model selection possible, measure of uncertainty (in
  Bayesian approaches).  *Limitations*: computer-intensive, model selection
  possibly cumbersome.

The R software implements one of the largest selections of phylogenetic
methods, including all of the above except for Bayesian reconstruction.



## Required packages

This practical requires a working version of \Rlogo~ [@R_Core_Team2017-dg]
greater than or equal to 2.15.2.  It uses the following packages: *stats*
implements basic hierarchical clustering routines, *ade4* [@Dray2007-nv] and
*adegenet* [@Jombart2008-xi; @Jombart2011-fb] are here used essentially for
their graphics, *ape* [@Paradis2004-rj; Popescu2012-ct] is the core package for
phylogenetics, and *phangorn* [@Schliep2011-hf] implements parsimony and
likelihood-based methods.  Make sure that the dependencies are installed as well
when installing the packages:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("adegenet", dep=TRUE)
install.packages("phangorn", dep=TRUE)
```

Then load the packages using:
```{r practical-phylogenetics-2}
library(stats)
library(ade4)
library(ape)
library(adegenet)
library(phangorn)
```






## The data

The data used in this practical are DNA sequences of seasonal influenza (H3N2)
downloaded from Genbank
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).
Alignments have been realized beforehand using standard tools (Clustalw2 for
basic alignment and Jalview for refining the results).  We selected 80 isolates
genotyped for the hemagglutinin (HA) segment sampled in the US from 1993 to
2008.  The dataset consists of two files: i)
[`usflu.fasta`](../../data/usflu.fasta), a file containing aligned DNA sequences
and ii) [`usflu.annot.csv`](../../data/usflu.annot.csv), a comma-separated file
containing useful annotations of the sequences.

First download these files (right-click $\rightarrow$ *Save Link As...*) and store
them in a folder `data/` in your working directory.  To read the DNA sequences
into R, we use `fasta2DNAbin` from the *adegenet* package:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-3, eval = FALSE}
dna <- fasta2DNAbin(file = "data/usflu.fasta")
dna
class(dna)
```
```{r practical-phylogenetics-4, echo = FALSE}
dna <- fasta2DNAbin(file = "../../static/data/usflu.fasta")
dna
class(dna)
```

Sequences are stored as `DNAbin` objects, an efficient representation of DNA/RNA
sequences which use bytes (as opposed to character strings) to code nucleotides,
resulting in considerable savings in terms of memory required to store the data.
While the present dataset is very small, such compression can become essential
for larger genomes (bacterial genomes are typically a few millions of
nucleotides long).  Note that for even larger datasets, more efficient data
reduction can be achieved using the bit-level coding of polymorphic sites
implemented in *adegenet* [@Jombart2011-fb].

The annotation file is read in R using the standard procedure:
```{r practical-phylogenetics-5, eval = FALSE}
annot <- read.csv("data/usflu.annot.csv",
                  header = TRUE, row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
```{r practical-phylogenetics-6, echo = FALSE}
annot <- read.csv("../../static/data/usflu.annot.csv",
                  header = TRUE, row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
```{r practical-phylogenetics-7}
head(annot)
dim(annot)
```

`accession` contains the Genbank accession numbers, which are unique sequence
identifiers; `year` is the year of collection of the isolates; `misc` contains
other possibly useful information.  Before going further, we check that isolates
are identical in both files (accession numbers are used as labels for the
sequences):

```{r practical-phylogenetics-8}
dim(dna)
dim(annot)
all(annot$accession == rownames(dna))
table(annot$year)
```

Good!  The data we will analyse are 80 isolates (5 per year) typed for the same
1701 nucleotides.






# Distance-based phylogenies

Distance-based phylogenetic reconstruction consists in i) computing pairwise
genetic distances between individuals (here, isolates), ii) representing these
distances using a tree, and iii) evaluating the relevance of this
representation.

## Computing genetic distances

We first compute genetic distances using *ape*'s `dist.dna`, which
proposes no less than 15 different genetic distances (see `?dist.dna` for
details).  Here, we use Tamura and Nei 1993's model [@Tamura1993-ob] which allows
for different rates of transitions and transversions, heterogeneous base
frequencies, and between-site variation of the substitution rate.

```{r practical-phylogenetics-9}
D <- dist.dna(dna, model = "TN93")
class(D)
length(D)
```

`D` is an object of class `dist` which contains the distances between every
pairs of sequences.

Now that genetic distances between isolates have been computed, we need to
visualize this information.  There are *n(n-1)/2* distances for *n* sequences;
here, *n=80* so that the genetic relationships between the sampled isolates are
described by $80 \times 79 / 2 = 3160$ pairwise distances.  Most of the time,
summarising such information is not entirely trivial.  The simplest approach is
plotting directly the matrix of pairwise distances:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-10, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
temp <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(D))
table.paint(temp, cleg = 0, clabel.row = .5, clabel.col = .5)
```


Darker shades of grey represent greater distances.  Note that to use `image` to
produce similar plots, data need to be transformed first; for instance:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-11}
temp <- t(as.matrix(D))
temp <- temp[,ncol(temp):1]
```
```{r practical-phylogenetics-12, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
par(mar = c(1,5,5,1))
image(x = 1:80, y = 1:80, temp, col = rev(heat.colors(100)),
      xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", xlab="",ylab="")
axis(side = 2, at = 1:80, lab = rev(rownames(dna)), las = 2, cex.axis = .5)
axis(side = 3, at = 1:80, lab = rownames(dna), las = 3, cex.axis = .5)
```


(see `image.plot` in the package *fields* for similar plots with a legend).

Since the data are roughly ordered by year, we can already see some genetic
structure appearing, but this is admittedly not the most satisfying or
informative approach, and tells us little about the evolutionary relationships
between our isolates.



## Building trees

We use trees to get a better representation of the genetic distances between
individuals.  It is important, however, to bear in mind that the obtained trees
are not necessarily efficient representations of the original distances, and
information can (and likely will) be lost in the process.

A wide array of algorithms for constructing trees from a distance matrix are
available in R, including:

- `nj` (*ape* package): the classical Neighbor-Joining algorithm.

- `bionj` (*ape*): an improved version of Neighbor-Joining.

- `fastme.bal` and `fastme.ols` (*ape*): minimum evolution algorithms. `hclust`
   (*stats*): classical hierarchical clustering algorithms including single
   linkage, complete linkage, UPGMA, and others.

Here, we go for the standard:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-13, fig.width = 8}
tre <- nj(D)
class(tre)
tre <- ladderize(tre)
tre
plot(tre, cex = .6)
title("A simple NJ tree")
```

Trees created in the package *ape* are instances of the class `phylo`.
See `?read.tree` for a description of this class.





## Plotting trees

The plotting method offers many possibilities for plotting trees; see
`?plot.phylo` for more details.  Functions such as `tiplabels`, `nodelabels`,
`edgelabels` and `axisPhylo` can also be useful to annotate trees.  For
instance, we may simply represent years using different colors (red = ancient;
blue = recent):

```{r practical-phylogenetics-14, fig.width=8}
plot(tre, show.tip = FALSE)
title("Unrooted NJ tree")
myPal <- colorRampPalette(c("red","yellow","green","blue"))
tiplabels(annot$year, bg = num2col(annot$year, col.pal = myPal),
          cex=.5)
temp <- pretty(1993:2008, 5)
legend("bottomleft", fill = num2col(temp, col.pal = myPal),
       leg = temp, ncol = 2)
```

This illustrates a common mistake when interpreting phylogenetic trees.  In the
above figures, we tend to assume that the left-side of the phylogeny is
`ancestral', while the right-side is 'recent'.  This is wrong (as suggested by
the colors) unless the phylogeny is actually rooted, i.e. some external taxa has
been used to define what is the most 'ancient' split in the tree. The present
tree is not rooted, and should be better represented as such:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-15}
plot(tre, type = "unrooted", show.tip = FALSE)
title("Unrooted NJ tree")
tiplabels(tre$tip.label, bg = num2col(annot$year, col.pal = myPal),
          cex = .5)
```

In the present case, a sensible rooting would be any of the most ancient
isolates (from 1993). We can take the first one:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-16}
head(annot)
tre2 <- root(tre, out = 1)
tre2 <- ladderize(tre2)
```

and plot the result:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-17}
plot(tre2, show.tip = FALSE, edge.width = 2)
title("Rooted NJ tree")
tiplabels(tre$tip.label,
          bg = transp(num2col(annot$year, col.pal = myPal),.7),
          cex = .5, fg = "transparent")
axisPhylo()
temp <- pretty(1993:2008, 5)
legend("topright",
       fill = transp(num2col(temp, col.pal = myPal),.7),
       leg = temp, ncol = 2)
```

The phylogeny is now rooted.  The shape of this tree is typical of influenza.
What can you say about the evolution of influenza and the fitness of different
viral lineages, based on this tree?  What does the 'trunk' of this tree
represent?  Would there be any interest in predicting the genome of the trunk?





## Estimating a molecular clock

Rooted trees are also useful for assessing the rate of evolution of a given
gene.  We call **molecular clock** the accumulation of mutations over time.  Can
you visually assess if there are signs of a molecular clock in this tree?  A
quantitative analysis is very easy to perform, and merely relies on regressing
the number of mutations from the root to the time of divergence from the root:

```{r molecular-clock}
mutFromRoot <- as.matrix(dist.dna(dna, model = "N"))[1,]
yearFromRoot <- annot$year - annot$year[1]
plot(mutFromRoot ~ yearFromRoot, xlab = "Years from the root",
     ylab = "Mutations from the root", main = "H3N2 molecular clock")
lm.clock <- lm(mutFromRoot ~ -1 + yearFromRoot)
abline(lm.clock, col = "blue",lwd = 2)
summary(lm.clock)
lm.clock$coefficients
lm.clock$coefficients/ncol(dna)
365/ lm.clock$coefficients
```

What is the substitution rate per year for the HA segment? What is the
substitution rate per year and per site?  On average, how many days would you
expect to wait before observing one mutation on a transmission chain?  Knowing
that the generation time of influenza is roughly around 2-3 days, would you
recommend using HA sequences for reconstructing transmission trees of influenza
epidemics?  What alternative would you suggest?







## Assessing the quality of a phylogeny

Many genetic distances and hierarchical clustering algorithms can be used to
build trees; not all of them are appropriate for a given dataset. Genetic
distances rely on hypotheses about the evolution of DNA sequences which should
be taken into account.  For instance, the mere proportion of differing
nucleotides between sequences (`model = 'raw`} in `dist.dna`) is easy to
interprete, but only makes sense if all substitutions are equally frequent. In
practice, simple yet flexible models such as that of Tamura and Nei
[@Tamura1993-ob] are probably fair choices.  At the very least, the genetic
distance used should allow different rates for transitions (*a <-> g*, *c <->
t*) and transversions (other changes).

<br>


Once one has chosen an appropriate genetic distance and built a tree using this
distance, an essential yet most often overlooked question is whether this tree
actually is a good representation of the original distance matrix. This is
easily investigated using simple biplots and correlation indices. The function
`cophenetic` is used to compute distances between the tips of the tree.  Note
that more distances are available in the *adephylo* package (see `distTips`
function).

```{r practical-phylogenetics-18}
x <- as.vector(D)
y <- as.vector(as.dist(cophenetic(tre2)))
plot(x, y, xlab = "original pairwise distances", ylab = "pairwise distances on the tree",
     main = "Is NJ appropriate?", pch = 20, col = transp("black",.1), cex = 3)
abline(lm(y~x), col = "red")
cor(x,y)^2
```

As it turns out, our Neighbor-Joining tree (`tre2`) is a very good
representation of the chosen genetic distances.  Things would have been
different had we chosen, for instance, UPGMA:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-19}
tre3 <- as.phylo(hclust(D,method = "average"))
y <- as.vector(as.dist(cophenetic(tre3)))
plot(x, y, xlab = "original pairwise distances", ylab = "pairwise distances on the tree",
     main = "Is UPGMA appropriate?", pch = 20, col = transp("black",.1), cex = 3)
abline(lm(y~x), col = "red")
cor(x,y)^2
```

In this case, UPGMA is a poor choice. Why is this?  A first explanation is that
UPGMA forces ultrametry (all the tips are equidistant to the root):

```{r practical-phylogenetics-20}
plot(tre3, cex = .5)
title("UPGMA tree")
```

The underlying assumption is that all lineages have undergone the same amount of
evolution, which is obviously not the case in seasonal influenza sampled over 16
years.
<br>



Another validation of phylogenetic trees, much more commonly used, is bootstrap.
Bootstrapping a phylogeny consists in sampling the nucleotides with replacement,
rebuilding the phylogeny, and checking if the original nodes are present in the
bootstrapped trees.  In practice, this procedure is repeated a large number of
times (e.g. 100, 1000), depending on how computer-intensive the phylogenetic
reconstruction is.  The underlying idea is to assess the variability in the
obtained topology which results from conducting the analyses on a random sample
the genome.  Note that the assumption that the analysed sequences represent a
random sample of the genome is often dubious.  For instance, this is not the
case in our toy dataset, since HA segment has a different rate of evolution and
experiences different selective pressures from other segments of the influenza
genome.  We nonetheless illustrate the procedure, implemented by
`boot.phylo`:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-21, results = 'hide'}
myBoots <- boot.phylo(tre2, dna, function(e)
                      root(nj(dist.dna(e, model = "TN93")),1))
myBoots
```

The output gives the number of times each node was identified in bootstrapped
analyses (the order is the same as in the original object).  It is easily
represented using `nodelabels`:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-22}
plot(tre2, show.tip = FALSE, edge.width = 2)
title("NJ tree + bootstrap values")
tiplabels(frame = "none", pch = 20,
          col = transp(num2col(annot$year, col.pal = myPal),.7),
          cex = 3, fg = "transparent")
axisPhylo()
temp <- pretty(1993:2008, 5)
legend("topright", fill = transp(num2col(temp, col.pal = myPal),.7),
       leg = temp, ncol = 2)
nodelabels(myBoots, cex = .6)
```

As we can see, some nodes are very poorly supported. One common practice is to
collapse these nodes into multifurcations. There is no dedicated method for this
in *ape*, but one simple workaround consists in setting the corresponding edges
to a length of zero (here, with bootstrap <70%), and then collapsing the small
branches:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-23}
temp <- tre2
N <- length(tre2$tip.label)
toCollapse <- match(which(myBoots<70)+N, temp$edge[,2])
temp$edge.length[toCollapse] <- 0
tre3 <- di2multi(temp, tol = 0.00001)
```

The new tree might be slightly less informative, but more robust than the
previous one:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-24 }
plot(tre3, show.tip = FALSE, edge.width = 2)
title("NJ tree after collapsing weak nodes")
tiplabels(tre3$tip.label, bg = transp(num2col(annot$year, col.pal = myPal), .7),
          cex = .5, fg = "transparent")
axisPhylo()
temp <- pretty(1993:2008, 5)
legend("topright", fill = transp(num2col(temp, col.pal = myPal), .7),
       leg = temp, ncol = 2)
```






# Maximum parsimony phylogenies

## Introduction

Phylogenetic reconstruction based on parsimony seeks trees which minimize the
total number of changes (substitutions) from ancestors to descendents.  While a
number of criticisms can be made to this approach, it is a simple way to infer
phylogenies for data which display low divergence (i.e. most taxa differ from
each other by only a few nucleotides, and the overall substitution rate is low).
<br>

In practice, there is often no way to perform an exhaustive search amongst all
possible trees to find the most parsimonious one, and heuristic algorithms are
used to browse the space of possible trees.  The strategy is fairly simple: i)
initialize the algorithm using a tree and ii) make small changes to the tree and
retain those leading to better parsimony, until the parsimony score stops
improving.


## Implementation

Parsimony-based phylogenetic reconstruction is implemented in the package
*phangorn*.  It requires a tree (in *ape*'s format, i.e. a `phylo` object) and
the original DNA sequences in *phangorn*'s own format, `phyDat`.  We convert the
data and generate a tree to initialize the method:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-25}
dna2 <- as.phyDat(dna)
class(dna2)
dna2
tre.ini <- nj(dist.dna(dna,model = "raw"))
tre.ini
```
The parsimony of a given tree is given by:
```{r practical-phylogenetics-26}
parsimony(tre.ini, dna2)
```
Then, optimization of the parsimony is achieved by:
```{r practical-phylogenetics-27}
tre.pars <- optim.parsimony(tre.ini, dna2)
tre.pars
```

Here, the final result is very close to the original tree.  The obtained tree is
unrooted and does not have branch lengths, but it can be plotted as previously:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-28}
plot(tre.pars, type = "unr", show.tip = FALSE, edge.width = 2)
title("Maximum-parsimony tree")
tiplabels(tre.pars$tip.label, bg = transp(num2col(annot$year, col.pal = myPal),.7),
          cex = .5, fg = "transparent")
temp <- pretty(1993:2008, 5)
legend("bottomright", fill = transp(num2col(temp, col.pal = myPal),.7),
       leg = temp, ncol = 2, bg = transp("white"))
```

In this case, parsimony gives fairly consistent results with other approaches,
which is only to be expected whenever the amount of divergence between the
sequences is fairly low, as is the case in our data.






# Maximum likelihood phylogenies


## Introduction

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction is somehow similar to parsimony
methods in that it browses a space of possible tree topologies looking for the
'best' tree.  However, it offers far more flexibility in that any model of
sequence evolution can be taken into account.  Given one model of evolution, one
can compute the likelihood of a given tree, and therefore optimization
procedures can be used to infer both the most likely tree topology and model
parameters.
<br>

As in distance-based methods, model-based phylogenetic reconstruction requires
thinking about which parameters should be included in a model.  Usually, all
possible substitutions are allowed to have different rates, and the substitution
rate is allowed to vary across sites according to a gamma distribution.  We
refer to this model as GTR + $\Gamma(4)$ (GTR: global time reversible).
More information about phylogenetic models can be found in [@Kelchner2007-oy].





## Getting a ML tree

Likelihood-based phylogenetic reconstruction is implemented in the package
*phangorn*.  As in the previous section, we use the data `dna2`, converted into
*phangorn*'s format.  We choose a Neighbor-Joining tree of Tamura and Nei's 1993
distance to get an initial tree.

```{r practical-phylogenetics-29}
class(dna2)
dna2
tre.ini <- nj(dist.dna(dna,model = "TN93"))
tre.ini
```



This tree is most likely not the ML tree, but we need it as a 'reasonable'
starting point to initialize the optimization procedure. The likelihood of this
initial tree is computed using `pml`:
	
```{r options2, include = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE)
```

```{r practical-phylogenetics-30}
fit.ini <- pml(tre.ini, dna2, k = 4)
fit.ini
```

We now have all the information needed for seeking a maximum likelihood solution
using `optim.pml`; we specify that we want to optimize tree topology
(`optNni = TRUE`), base frequencies (`optBf = TRUE`), the rates of
all possible subtitutions (`optQ = TRUE`), and use a gamma distribution
to model variation in the substitution rates across sites (`optGamma =
TRUE`):

```{r practical-phylogenetics-31, echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
fit <- optim.pml(fit.ini, optNni = TRUE, optBf = TRUE,
                 optQ = TRUE, optGamma = TRUE)
```
```{r practical-phylogenetics-32}
fit
class(fit)
names(fit)
```

`fit` is a list with class `pml` storing various useful information about the
model parameters and the optimal tree (stored in `fit$tree`).  In this example,
we can see from the output that transitions (*a <-> g* and *c <-> t*) are much
more frequent than transversions (other changes), which is consistent with
biological expectations (transversions induce more drastic changes of chemical
properties of the DNA and are more prone to purifying selection).  One advantage
of using probabilistic models of evolution is that different models can be
compared formally.  For instance, here, we can verify that the optimized tree is
indeed better than the original one using standard likelihood ratio tests and
AIC:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-33}
anova(fit.ini, fit)
AIC(fit.ini)
AIC(fit)
```

Both the likelihood ratio test (highly significant, function `anova`) and the
AIC (lower = better) indicate that the new tree is a better model of the data
than the initial one.


We can extract and plot the tree as we did before with other methods:

```{r practical-phylogenetics-34}
tre4 <- root(fit$tree,1)
tre4 <- ladderize(tre4)
plot(tre4, show.tip = FALSE, edge.width = 2)
title("Maximum-likelihood tree")
tiplabels(annot$year,
          bg = transp(num2col(annot$year, col.pal = myPal), .7),
          cex = .5, fg = "transparent")
axisPhylo()
temp <- pretty(1993:2008, 5)
legend("topright", fill = transp(num2col(temp, col.pal = myPal), .7),
       leg = temp, ncol = 2)
```

This tree is statistically better than the original NJ tree based on Tamura and
Nei's distance [@Tamura1993-ob].  However, we can note that it is remarkably similar
to the 'robust' version of this distance-based tree (after collapsing weakly
supported nodes).  The structure of this dataset is fairly simple, and all
methods give fairly consistent results.  In practice, different methods can lead
to different interpretations, and it is often worth exploring different
approaches before drawing conclusions on the data.
