This practical simulates the early assessment and reconstruction of an Ebola
Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak. It introduces various aspects of analysis of the early
stage of an outbreak, including contact tracing data, epicurves, growth rate
estimation from log-linear models, and more refined estimates of
transmissibility. A follow-up practical will provide an introduction to
transmission chain reconstruction using *outbreaker2*.

# A novel EVD outbreak in Ankh, Republic of Morporkia

A new EVD outbreak has been notified in the small city of Ankh, located in the
Northern, rural district of the Republic of Morporkia. Public Health Morporkia
(PHM) is in charge of coordinating the outbreak response, and have contracted
you as a consultant in epidemics analysis to inform the response in real time. 



## Required packages

The following packages, available on CRAN, are needed for this case study:

- [`readxl`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html) to read `.xlsx` files
- [`outbreaks`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaks/) for some other outbreak data
- [`incidence`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/) for epicurves
- [`epicontacts`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/) for contact data visualisation
- [`distcrete`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/distcrete) to obtain discretised delay distributions
- [`epitrix`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epitrix) to fit discretised Gamma distributions
- [`earlyR`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/earlyR) to estimate $R_0$ 
- [`projections`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/projections) for short term forecasting 

To install these packages, use `install.packages`, e.g.:
   
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("outbreaks")
install.packages("incidence")
install.packages("epicontacts")
install.packages("distcrete")
install.packages("epitrix")
install.packages("earlyR")
install.packages("projections")
```



    
## Early data
	
While a new data update is pending, you have been given the following linelist
and contact data, from the early stages of the outbreak:

- [PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx](../../data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx):
  a linelist containing case information up to the 27th October 2017

- [PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-10-27.xlsx](../../data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-10-27.xlsx):
  a list of contacts reported between cases up to the 27th October 2017, where
  `from` indicates a potential source of infection, and `to` the recipient of
  the contact.
  

To read into R, download these files and use the function `read_xlsx()` from the
`readxl` package to import the data. Each import will create a data table stored
as a `tibble` object. Call the first one `linelist`, and the second one
`contacts`. For instance, you first command line could look like:
	
```{r practical-ebola-response-1, eval = FALSE}
linelist <- readxl::read_xlsx("PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx")
```

Note that for further analyses, you will need to make sure all dates are stored
as `Date` objects. This can be done using `as.Date`:

```{r date-conversion, echo = -c(1, 2)}
linelist <- readxl::read_xlsx("../../static/data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-10-27.xlsx")
contacts <- readxl::read_xlsx("../../static/data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-10-27.xlsx")
linelist$onset <- as.Date(linelist$onset)
```


Once imported, the data should look like:
          
```{r read_files}
## linelist: one line per case
linelist

## contacts: pairs of cases with reported contacts
contacts
```



# Descriptive analyses

## A first look at contacts

Contact tracing is at the centre of an Ebola outbreak response. Using the
function `make_epicontacts` in the `epicontacts` package, create a new
`epicontacts` object called `x`. The result should look like:
	      
```{r epicontacts, echo = -c(1,2)}
library(epicontacts)
x <- make_epicontacts(linelist,
                      contacts, directed = TRUE)
x
```  

You can easily plot these contacts, but with a little bit of tweaking (see
`?vis_epicontacts`) you can customise shapes by gender:

```{r epicontacts_plot, echo = 1:2, eval = -2}
p <- plot(x, node_shape = "sex", shapes = c(male = "male", female = "female"), selector = FALSE)
p
save_and_use_widget(p, "epicontacts_plot.html")
```

<font class="question">What can you say about these contacts?</font>
     

     
## Looking at incidence curves

The first question PHM asks you is simply: *how bad is it?*. Given that this is
a terrible disease, with a mortality rate nearing 70%, there is a lot of concern
about this outbreak getting out of control. The first step of the analysis lies
in drawing an *epicurve*, i.e. an plot of incidence over time.

<br>

Using the package `incidence`, compute daily incidence based on the dates of
symptom onset. Store the result in an object called `i`; the result should look
like:

```{r incidence, echo = -c(1,2), out.width = "80%", fig.width = 10}
library(incidence)
i <- incidence(linelist$onset)
i
plot(i)
```

If you pay close attention to the dates on the x-axis, you may notice that
something is missing. Indeed, the graph stops right after the last case, while
the data should be complete until the 27th October 2017. You can remedy this
using the argument `last_date` in the `incidence` function:
      

```{r incidence_rectif, out.width = "80%", fig.width = 10}
i <- incidence(linelist$onset, last_date = as.Date("2017-10-27"))
i
plot(i)
```



# Statistical analyses

## Log-linear model

The simplest model of incidence is probably the log-linear model, i.e. a linear
regression on log-transformed incidences. In the `incidence` package, the
function `fit` will estimate the parameters of this model from an incidence
object (here, `i`). Apply it to the data and store the result in a new object
called `f`. You can print `f` to derive estimates of the growth rate $r$ and the
doubling time, and add the corresponding model to the incidence plot:

```{r fit, out.width = "80%", fig.width = 10}
f <- fit(i)
f
plot(i, fit = f)
```

<font class="question">How would you interpret this result?What criticism would
you make on this model?</font>

<!-- As an aid for interpretation, you are reminded of previous observations of the -->
<!-- serial interval distribution, estimated during the West African EVD outbreak -->
<!-- (WHO Ebola Response Team (2014) NEJM 371:1481–1495) with a mean of 15.3 days and -->
<!-- a standard deviation 9.3 days. -->
     


## Estimation of transmissibility ($R$)

### Branching process model

The transmissibility of the disease can be assessed through the estimation of
the reproduction number $R$, defined as the number of expected secondary cases
per infected case. In the early stages of an outbreak, and assuming no immunity
in the population, this quantity is also the basic reproduction number $R_0$,
i.e. $R$ in a fully susceptible population. 

<br>

The package `earlyR` implements a simple maximum-likelihood estimation of $R$,
using dates of onset of symptoms and information on the serial interval
distribution. It is a simpler but less flexible version of the model by Cori et
al (2013, AJE 178: 1505–1512) implemented in
[`EpiEstim`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html). 

<br>

Briefly, `earlyR` uses a simple model describing incidence on a given day as a
Poisson process determined by a global force of infection on that day:
$$
x_t \sim \mathcal{P} (\lambda_t)
$$

where $x_t$ is the incidence (based on symptom onset) on day $t$ and $\lambda_t$
is the force of infection. Noting $R$ the reproduction number and $w()$ the
discrete serial interval distribution, we have:

$$
\lambda_t = R * \sum_{s=1}^t x_s w(t - s)
$$

The likelihood (probability of observing the data given the model and
parameters) is defined as a function of $R$:

$$
\mathcal{L}(x)  = p(x | R) = \prod_{t=1}^T F_{\mathcal{P}}(x_t, \lambda_t)
$$

where $F_{\mathcal{P}}$ is the Poisson probability mass function.



### Looking into the past: estimating the serial interval from older data

As current data are insufficient to estimate the **serial interval** distribution,
some colleague recommends using data from a **past outbreak** stored in the
`outbreaks` package, as the dataset `ebola_sim_clean`. Load this dataset, and
create a new `epicontacts` object as before, without plotting it (it is a much
larger dataset). Store the new object as `old_evd`; the output should look like:

```{r old_evd, echo = 3}
library(outbreaks)
old_evd <- make_epicontacts(ebola_sim_clean$linelist, ebola_sim_clean$contacts, directed = TRUE)
old_evd
```

The function `get_pairwise` can be used to extract pairwise features of contacts
based on attributes of the linelist. For instance, it could be used to test for
assortativity, but also to compute delays between connected cases. Here, we use
it to extract the serial interval:

```{r old_si}
old_si <- get_pairwise(old_evd, "date_of_onset")
summary(old_si)
old_si <- na.omit(old_si)
summary(old_si)
hist(old_si, xlab = "Days after symptom onset", ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Serial interval (empirical distribution)",
     col = "grey", border = "white")
```

<font class="question">What do you think of this distribution?</font> Make the
adjustments you deem necessary, and then use the function `fit_disc_gamma` from
the package `epitrix` to fit a discretised Gamma distribution to these
data. Your results should approximately look like:

```{r old_si_fit, echo = -(1:2)}
library(epitrix)
old_si <- old_si[old_si < 60]
si_fit <- fit_disc_gamma(old_si)
si_fit
```

`si_fit` contains various information about the fitted delays, including the
estimated distribution in the `$distribution` slot. You can compare this
distribution to the empirical data in the following plot:

```{r si}
si <- si_fit$distribution
si

## compare fitted distribution to data
hist(old_si, xlab = "Days after symptom onset", ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Serial interval: fit to data", col = "salmon", border = "white",
     nclass = 50, ylim = c(0, 0.07), prob = TRUE)
points(0:60, si$d(0:60), col = "#9933ff", pch = 20)
points(0:60, si$d(0:60), col = "#9933ff", type = "l", lty = 2)
```

<font class="question">Would you trust this estimation of the generation
time?</font> <font class="question">How would you compare it to actual estimates
from the West African EVD outbreak (WHO Ebola Response Team (2014) NEJM
371:1481–1495) with a mean of 15.3 days and a standard deviation 9.3 days?</font>
  


### Back to the future: estimation of $R_0$ in the current outbreak

Now that we have estimates of the serial interval based on a previous outbreak,
we can use this information to estimate transmissibility of the disease (as
measured by $R_0$) in the current outbreak.

Using the estimates of the mean and standard deviation of the serial interval
you just obtained, use the function `get_R` to estimate the reproduction number,
specifying a maximum R of 10 (see `?get_R`) and store the result in a new object
`R`:

```{r estimate-R, echo = FALSE}

library(earlyR)
R <- get_R(i, si = si_fit$distribution, max_R = 10)

```

You can visualise the results as follows:

```{r plot-r}
R
plot(R)
plot(R, "lambdas")
abline(v = linelist$onset, lty = 2)

```

The first figure shows the distribution of likely values of *R*, and the
Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation. The second figure shows the global force of
infection over time, with dashed bars indicating dates of onset of the cases.

<font class="question">Interpret these results: what do you make of the
reproduction number?What does it reflect? Based on the last part of the epicurve,
some colleagues suggest that incidence is going down and the outbreak may be
under control. What is your opinion on this?</font>



## Short-term forecasting

The function `project` from the package `projections` can be used to simulate
plausible epidemic trajectories by simulating daily incidence using the same
branching process as the one used to estimate $R_0$ in `earlyR`. All that is
needed is one or several values of $R_0$ and a serial interval distribution,
stored as a `distcrete` object.

Here, we illustrate how we can simulate 5 random trajectories using a fixed
value of $R_0$ = `r round(R$R_ml,2)`, the ML estimate of $R_0$:

```{r project_expl}
library(projections)
project(i, R = R$R_ml, si = si, n_sim = 5, n_days = 10, R_fix_within = TRUE)
```

Using the same principle, generate 1,000 trajectories for the next 2 weeks, using
a range of plausible values of $R_0$. Note that you can use `sample_R` to obtain
these values from your `earlyR` object. Store your results in an object called
`proj`. Plotting the results should give something akin to:

```{r project, echo = -3, out.width = "80%", fig.width = 10}
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
proj <- project(i, R = sample_R(R, 1000), si = si,
                n_sim = 1000, n_days = 14,
                R_fix_within = TRUE)
plot(i) %>% add_projections(proj, c(.1,.9)) + scale_x_date()
```

Interpret the following summary:
```{r proj_summary}
apply(proj, 1, summary)
apply(proj, 1, function(x) mean(x>0))
```

<font class="question">According to these results, what are the chances that more cases will appear in the near future?</font><font class="question">Is this outbreak being brought under control?</font>
<font class="question">Would you recommend scaling up / down the response?</font>





## Follow-up...

For a follow-up on this outbreak, have a look at the [second
part](./practical-ebola-reconstruction.html) of this simulated response,
which includes a data update, genetic sequences, and the use of outbreak
reconstruction tools.
