This practical is the second part of the response to a simulated Ebola Virus
Disease (EVD) outbreak taking place in the city of Ankh, Republic of
Morporkia. While the [first part](./simulated-evd-early.html) focussed on early
assessments of transmissibility, this part explores more methodological options
for estimating transmissibility, and provides an introduction to outbreak
reconstruction using *outbreaker2*.

# An update on the EVD outbreak in Ankh, Republic of Morporkia

After some rather concerning [preliminary results](../simulated-evd-early) on
the new EVD outbreak in the city of Ankh, Republic of Morporkia, Public Health
Morporkia (PHM) has sent you updates of the linelists and contact data. This
time, PHM has also obtained Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) of the Ebola virus
isolated in patients. As before, you are asked to assess the situation and
produce evidence-based recommendations for informing the response.

    

## Required packages

The following packages, available on CRAN, are needed for this practical:

- [`readxl`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html) to read `.xlsx` files
- [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.org/) for graphics
- [`incidence`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/) for epicurves
- [`epicontacts`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/) for contact
  data visualisation
- [`EpiEstim`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html) for
  time-varying reproduction number estimation
- [`distcrete`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/distcrete) to obtain
  discrete time delay distributions
- [`epitrix`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epitrix) for some practical
  tricks for epidemics analysis
- [`ape`](http://ape-package.ird.fr/) for DNA sequence analysis
- [`outbreaker2`](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2) to
  reconstruct the outbreak
  
To install these packages, use `install.packages`, e.g.:
   
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("incidence")
install.packages("epicontacts")
install.packages("EpiEstim")
install.packages("distcrete")
install.packages("epitrix")
install.packages("ape")
install.packages("outbreaker2")
```

 


## The new data
	
The data update includes new linelists and contact lists:

- [PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx](../../data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx):
  a linelist containing case information up to the 25th November 2017

- [PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-11-25.xlsx](../../data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-11-25.xlsx):
  a list of contacts reported between cases up to the 25th November, where
  `from` indicates a potential source of infection, and `to` the recipient of
  the contact.
  

To read into R, download these files and use the function `read_xlsx()` from the
`readxl` package to import the data. Each import will create a data table stored
as a `tibble` object. Call the first one `linelist`, and the second one
`contacts`. For instance, your first command line could look like:
	
	
```{r practical-ebola-reconstruction-1, eval = FALSE}
linelist <- readxl::read_xlsx("PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx")
```

Note that for further analyses, you will need to make sure all dates are stored
as `Date` objects. This can be done using `as.Date`:

```{r date-conversion, echo = -c(1, 2)}
linelist <- readxl::read_xlsx("../../static/data/PHM-EVD-linelist-2017-11-25.xlsx")
contacts <- readxl::read_xlsx("../../static/data/PHM-EVD-contacts-2017-11-25.xlsx")
linelist$onset <- as.Date(linelist$onset)
```


Once imported, the data should look like:
          
```{r read_files}
## linelist: one line per case
linelist

## contacts: pairs of cases with reported contacts
contacts
```



# Analysis of epidemiological data

## Visualising contact data

After the initial stage of the outbreak, contact tracing has been maintained but
started being sparser, and exposures haven't been reported for all
cases. Despite these limitations, contacts are still a valuable source of
information. Using the function `make_epicontacts` in the `epicontacts` package,
create a new `epicontacts` object called `x`, specifying that contacts are
directed. When plotting the data, use the arguments `node_shape` and `shapes`
(see `?vis_epicontacts`) to distinguish males and females. For a list of
available symbols and corresponding shape code, you can type
`epicontacts::codeawesome`.

The results should look like:
	      
```{r ebola_recons_epicontacts_1, echo = FALSE, eval = -5}
library(epicontacts)
x <- make_epicontacts(linelist, contacts, directed = TRUE)
x
p <- plot(x, node_shape = "sex", shapes = c(male = "male", female = "female"), selector = FALSE)
p
save_and_use_widget(p, "ebola_recons_epicontacts_1.html")

```

<font class="question">What can you say about these contacts? How would you
interpret the different clusters?</font>
     

     
## Building epicurves

Using the same approach as in the [first part](../simulated-evd-early) of the
practical, use `incidence` (from the `incidence` package) to compute and plot
epicurves using dates of symptom onset. As the time series is now longer,
compare daily incidence to weekly incidence. 

You should obtain something like:

```{r incidence, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(incidence)
i <- incidence(linelist$onset)
plot(i)
i <- incidence(linelist$onset, interval = 7)
plot(i)
```

As there are no longer time intervals with 'zero' incidence on the weekly
epicurve, which are problematic for log-linear regression, we can try fitting a
model to these data; we do so here, with `i` being the weekly incidence:

```{r fit}
f <- fit(i)
f
plot(i, color = "#c65353", fit = f)
```

How would you interpret this result? What are the limitations of this analysis?



## Estimating transmissibility

Repeating the same analysis as in the [early stage](../simulated-evd-early) of
the outbreak, we can use `get_R` from the `earlyR` package to estimate the
reproduction number:

```{r basic_R}
library(earlyR)

## parameters of the serial interval from practical part1, on the dataset
## ebola_sim_clean (outbreaks package)

mu <- 11.48 # mean serial interval
sd <- 7.38 # standard deviation

daily_i <- incidence(linelist$onset)
simple_R <- get_R(daily_i, si_mean = mu, si_sd =  sd, max_R = 5)
simple_R

## R: likelihood function
plot(simple_R)

## force of infection
plot(simple_R, "lambdas")
abline(v = as.Date("2017-11-25"))
```

<font class="question">What do you make of these results?</font><font
class="question">What is the main limitation of the estimation of the
reproduction number ($R$) in this analysis?</font><font class="question"> What
assumption does it make about the outbreak?</font>



## Estimating time-varying transmissibility

When the assumption that $R$ is constant over time becomes untenable, an
alternative is the estimationg of time-varying transmissibility using the
instantaneous reproduction number $R_t$. This approach, introduced by Cori et
al. [-@Cori2013-fc], is implemented in the package `EpiEstim` (function
`EstimateR`). It esimates $R_t$ for a succession of sliding time windows, using
the same Poisson likelihood described in the [first
part](../simulated-evd-early). In the following, we use `EstimateR` to estimate
transmissibility for 1-week sliding time windows:

```{r epiestim}
library(EpiEstim)
library(ggplot2)

days <- seq_along(daily_i$dates)
Rt <- EstimateR(as.vector(daily_i$counts), days, days + 7, method = "ParametricSI",
                   Mean.SI = mu, Std.SI = sd)
Rt <- Rt$R[days,]
head(Rt, 10)

```

`EpiEstim` is not yet integrated with other RECON packages, so adding the
results to existing `incidence` plots takes some customisation using
`ggplot2`. Uses the following commands to add estimates of $R_r$ to the daily
incidence:

```{r epiestimplot}

names(Rt) <- gsub("[(]R[)]", "", names(Rt))
Rt <- cbind.data.frame(as.data.frame(daily_i),
                       Rt)
plot(daily_i) +
    geom_ribbon(data = Rt, fill = "#c65353", alpha = .3,
                aes(x = dates, ymin = Quantile.0.025, ymax = Quantile.0.975)) +
    geom_line(data = Rt, aes(x = dates, y = Median), col = "#c65353", alpha = .8) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = 2) +
    labs(title = "Weekly Rt: median, and 95% CI")

```

<font class="question">How would you interpret this result? What is the caveat
of this representation?</font>




# Finding who infected whom

To gain a better understanding of the transmission process, we can attempt to
reconstruct plausible transmission trees using the dates of symptom onsets and
limited contact data. This can be achieved using `outbreaker2`, which provides a
modular platform for outbreak reconstruction. This package extends and replaces
`outbreaker`, which in contrast was a static implementation of a specific
transmission model [@Jombart2014-ab].


## Looking at Whole Genome Sequences (WGS)

WGS have been obtained for all cases in this outbreak. They are stored as a
`fasta` [PHM-EVD-WGS.fa](../../data/PHM-EVD-WGS.fa). Download this
file, save it in your working directory, and then import these data using the
function `read.FASTA` from the `ape` package.

```{r practical-ebola-reconstruction-2, echo = -2, eval = -3}
library(ape)
dna <- read.FASTA("../../static/data/PHM-EVD-WGS.fa")
dna <- read.FASTA("PHM-EVD-WGS.fa")
dna
identical(labels(dna), linelist$case_id) # check sequences match linelist data
```

As a first exploration of the data, we derive a Neighbour-Joining tree rooted at
the first case of the outbreak:
```{r nj, fig.height = 8}
nj <- nj(dist.dna(dna, model = "N")) # NJ on nucleotide distances (model = "N")
nj
nj <- root(nj, 1)
plot(nj, main = "Neighbour Joining tree")
axisPhylo()
```

This phylogenetic tree shows the inferred evolution of the pathogen
sequences. Branch length (x-axis) correspond to the number of mutations occuring
between lineages (indicated by the axis at the bottom). The tree has been rooted
to the index case, so that this sequence (top, left) is the "most ancient" part
of the tree. Note that in such representations, distances on the y-axis are meaningless.


<font class="question">How would you interpret this phylogenetic tree? Many
methods of outbreak reconstruction infer transmission events from
phylogenies. What results would you expect here?</font>





## Building delay distributions

`outbreaker2` can handle different types of dates. When dates of onset are
provided, information on the *generation time* (delay between primary and
secondary infections) and on the *incubation period* (delay between infection and
symptom onset) can be included in the model. These delays are typically
modelled as Gamma distributions, which need to be discretised in order to
account for the fact that time is reported as days.


A possible approach here would be using estimates of the *mean* and *standard
deviation* of the incubation period and the generation time published in the
literature. From this, one would need to use `epitrix` to convert these
parameters into *shape* and *scale* for a Gamma distribution, and then use
`distcrete` to generate discretised distributions.


Alternatively, these parameters can be estimated from a previous, reasonably
similar outbreak. PHM asks you to use the dataset `ebola_sim_clean` from the
`outbreaks` package to this end. Start by extracting data on the inbucation
period (i.e. delay from infection to onset) and store the output in an object
called `incub`; results should look like:

```{r incubation, echo = -c(1,2)}
library(outbreaks)

incub <- with(ebola_sim_clean$linelist, date_of_onset - date_of_infection)
incub <- as.integer(na.omit(incub))
summary(incub)

hist(incub, col = terrain.colors(10), border = "white",
     main = "Incubation period",
     xlab = "Days after exposure")

```

Then, use `epicontacts` to extract data on the generation time (i.e. delay between
infections between infectors and infectees):

```{r generation-time, echo = -c(1,2)}
library(epicontacts)
ebola_sim_contacts <- with(ebola_sim_clean, make_epicontacts(linelist, contacts, directed = TRUE))
ebola_sim_contacts
gen_time <- get_pairwise(ebola_sim_contacts, "date_of_infection")
gen_time <- as.integer(na.omit(gen_time))
summary(gen_time)

hist(gen_time, col = terrain.colors(10), border = "white",
     main = "Generation time",
     xlab = "Days after exposure")

```

We can now fit a discretised Gamma distributions to both delays. The function
`fit_dist_gamma` in the package `epitrix` makes this fairly simple. We
illustrate the procedure for the incubation period:

```{r incub_dist}
library(epitrix)
incub_fit <- fit_disc_gamma(incub)
incub_fit
incub_dist <- incub_fit$distribution

plot(0:50, incub_dist$d(0:50), type = "h", col = terrain.colors(51),
     xlab = "Days after exposure", ylab = "Probability",
     main = "Incubation period distribution", lend = 1, lwd = 8)
```

Using the same process, create a distribution for the generation time. Results should resemble:

```{r gen_time_dist, echo = FALSE}
gen_time_fit <- fit_disc_gamma(gen_time)
gen_time_fit
gen_time_dist <- gen_time_fit$distribution

plot(0:50, gen_time_dist$d(0:50), type = "h", col = terrain.colors(51),
     xlab = "Days after infection", ylab = "Probability",
     main = "Generation time distribution", lend = 1, lwd = 8)
```





## Using the original `outbreaker` model

The original `outbreaker` model combined temporal information (here, dates of
onset) with sequence data to infer who infected whom. Here, we use `outbreaker2`
to apply this model to the data. 

All inputs to the new `outbreaker` function are prepared using dedicated
functions, which make a number of checks on provided inputs and define defaults:


```{r data-basic-outbreaker}
library(outbreaker2)

data <- outbreaker_data(dates = linelist$onset, # dates of onset
                        dna = unname(dna), # WGS; remove labels for compatibility
                        w_dens = gen_time_dist$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub_dist$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )
```

We also create a configuration, which determines different aspects of the
analysis, including which parameters need to be estimated, initial values of
parameters, the length of the MCMC, etc.:

```{r config-outbreaker}
config <- create_config(move_kappa = FALSE, # don't look for missing cases
                        move_pi = FALSE, # don't estimate reporting
                        init_pi = 1, # set reporting to 1
                        find_import = FALSE, # don't look for additional imported cases
                        init_tree = "star" # star-like tree as starting point
                        )
```

We can now run the analysis. This should take a couple of minutes on modern
laptops. Note the use of `set.seed(0)` to have identical results across
different users and computers:

```{r outbreaker-basic, cache = CACHE}
set.seed(0)
res_basic <- outbreaker(data = data, config = config)
res_basic
plot(res_basic)
plot(res_basic, burn = 500)

```

The first two plots show the trace of the log-posterior densities (with, and
without burnin). See `?plot.outbreaker_chains` for details on available
plots. Graphics worth looking at include:

```{r ebola_outbreaker_1, echo = 1:5, eval = -5}
plot(res_basic,  type = "alpha", burnin = 500) # ancestries
plot(res_basic,  type = "t_inf", burnin = 500) # infection dates
plot(res_basic, "mu", burn = 500, type = "density") # mutation rate
p <- plot(res_basic,  type = "network", burnin = 500, min_support = .05) # transmission trees
p
save_and_use_widget(p, "ebola_outbreaker_1.html")
```

As a further help for interpretation, you can derive a consensus tree from the
posterior samples of trees using `summary`. Look in particular at the *support*
column, and compare the results to the contact data.

```{r outbreaker-basic-summary}
smry_basic <- summary(res_basic)
head(smry_basic$tree)
tail(smry_basic$tree)
hist(smry_basic$tree$support, col = "grey", border = "white",
     main = "Consensus ancestry: support", xlim = c(0,1))
```

<font class="question">How would you interpret the results? Is this what you
would have expected?</font> 

As a point of comparison, repeat the same analysis
using temporal data only, and plot a graph of ancestries (`type = "alpha"`); you
should obtain something along the lines of:

```{r outbreaker-time}
set.seed(0)

data <- outbreaker_data(dates = linelist$onset, # dates of onset
                        w_dens = gen_time_dist$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub_dist$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )
res_time <- outbreaker(data = data, config = config)
plot(res_time, type = "alpha", burn = 500)

```

<font class="question">What is the usefulness of temporal and genetic data for
outbreak reconstruction? What other data would you ideally include?</font>



## Adding contact data to the reconstruction process

Contact data currently contains case labels. While `epicontacts` objects will
soon be accepted as inputs in `outbreaker2`, for now we need to operate some
minor transformations to define contacts using cases indices rather than labels:

```{r transform-contacts}
ctd <- matrix(match(unlist(x$contacts), linelist$case_id), ncol = 2)
head(ctd)
dim(ctd)
```

All inputs to the `outbreaker` function are prepared using dedicated functions,
which make a number of checks on provided inputs and define defaults:

```{r data-outbreaker-full}
data <- outbreaker_data(dates = linelist$onset, # dates of onset
                        dna = unname(dna), # dna sequences
                        ctd = ctd, # contact data
                        w_dens = gen_time_dist$d(1:100), # generation time distribution
                        f_dens = incub_dist$d(1:100) # incubation period distribution
                        )
```

We are now ready to run the analysis. This may take a couple of minutes,
depending on your computer:

```{r outbreaker-full, cache = CACHE}
set.seed(0)
res_full <- outbreaker(data = data, config = config)
res_full
```

Produce graphics as in the previous model. Assess convergence, choose an
appropriate burnin, visualise ancestries and the infection timelines:

```{r ebola_outbreaker_2, echo = FALSE, eval = -7}
plot(res_full) # log-posterior trace
plot(res_full, burnin = 200) # log-posterior trace
plot(res_full,  type = "alpha", burnin = 200) # ancestries
plot(res_full,  type = "t_inf", burnin = 200) # infection dates
p <- plot(res_full,  type = "network", burnin = 200, min_support = .05) # transmission trees
p
save_and_use_widget(p, "ebola_outbreaker_2.html")
```

<font class="question">How would you interpret the results?</font>

<br>

Derive a consensus tree using `summary`, and make a new `epicontacts` object,
using the previous linelist, to visualise the consensus tree with
meta-information:

```{r outbreaker-full-summary}
smry_full <- summary(res_full)
head(smry_full$tree)

smry_full$tree$support <- round(smry_full$tree$support, 2)

linelist$id <- 1:nrow(linelist) # add case index to linelist
cons_tree <- make_epicontacts(linelist, smry_full$tree[-1, ], id = "id",
                              from = 1, to = 2, directed = TRUE)

```

In the following, we add age class information to the linelist of `cons_tree`,
and create color palettes which will be used to display information on the final
graph:

```{r consensus-tree-making}
library(visNetwork)

support_pal <- colorRampPalette(
    c("#918D98", "#645877", "#423359", "#281449", "#1A0340")
)

age_pal <- colorRampPalette(
    c("#3288BD", "#ABDDA4", "#FDAE61", "#D53E4F")
)

cons_tree$linelist$age_class <- cut(cons_tree$linelist$age,
                                    breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 90),
                                    labels = c("0-10", "11-20", "21-30", "31-40", "41+" ))

```

Looking carefully at the documentation of `vis_epicontacts`, try to reproduce
the final consensus tree below:

```{r ebola_outbreaker_3, echo = FALSE, eval = -2}
p <- plot(cons_tree, edge_col = "support", edge_col_pal = support_pal,
          edge_label = "support", node_shape = "sex",
          shapes = c(male = "male", female = "female"), node_color = "age_class",
          col_pal = age_pal)
p
save_and_use_widget(p, "ebola_outbreaker_2.html")
   
```

<font class="question">What are your conclusions? What are the main drivers of
this outbreak? What recommendations would you make to further improve the
response?</font>
