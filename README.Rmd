Welcome to the *RECON learn* project
====================================

This github project hosts the sources of the
[RECON](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/) learn platform, live at:
[https://reconlearn.netlify.com/](https://reconlearn.netlify.com/).


This *RECON learn* website uses [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (`.Rmd`) documents to build markdown content that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) then turns into a nifty website.


## General workflow

The general workflow would include the following steps:

1. **Fork the project** from the github *RECON learn* project:


This will create a copy of the project in your own github account. You will need
to clone this archive, and make the modifications there. You `git clone` would look like:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/johnsnow/learn
```

If your github user name is `johnsnow`.  


2. **Add new content**, typically in the form of a new `.Rmd` file and
associated media (most often images). Regular posts such as practicals,
tutorials, and case studies are stored in `content/post/`. Other content which
is not rendered as typical html reports such as lecture slides can be stored in
`static`.

3. **Generate content** by using the `R/render_new_rmds_to_md.R` script, to build the `.md` files and associated graphics.

4. `git commit` and `git push` all changes; don't forget to add new images as
well (run `git status` to see which files haven't been added).

5. Make a **pull request** against the main project (`master` branch), from the github *RECON learn* project:


Make sure you use `reconhub/learn`, branch `master` as base fork:



## Contributing content

Practicals, tuorials, case studies are contributed as
[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (`.Rmd`) documents and generated markdown ready for conversion as `.md` documents. They are stored
in `content/post`. The best way to create a new document is copy-paste an
existing one and rename it. 

### Conventions
Naming conventions are as follows:

- start with `practical` for practicals, `study` for case studies
- use lower case, no special characters
- be hypen-separated ("-")

For instance, for a practical using a SEIR model for influenza data:

- `practical-seir-influenza` is good
- `SEIR-flu` is bad as lacking 'practical' (it could be a lecture), and has
  capitalised letters
- `practical-new` is bad, as it is non-informative

### Editing the YAML header

The YAML header is the beginning of the `Rmd` document, within the `---`. For instance:
```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
author: Thibaut Jombart
categories: ["practicals"]
topics: ["genetics"]
date: 2017-11-01
image: img/highres/trees.jpg
showonlyimage: true
bibliography: practical-phylogenetics.bib
licenses: CC-BY
---
```

Fields are mostly self-explanatory, and can be adapted to your needs. The date
should respect the format provided.

### Storing images
The **image** will be the image associated with the document on the website. We
try using natural, high-resolution, evocative images having a link, if only
figurative, with the topic covered. These images are stored in
`static/img/highres/`. Do not forget to add and push this file as well, as it
will be required for your post to be successfully integrated. The path to the
file provided in the header assumes `static/` as root folder (see example
above), so that the right path will look like: `img/highres/your-image.jpg`.

### Bibliographies
The **`bibliography`** is optional. If provided,
it should contain references cited in the document as a `bibtex` file
(`.bib`). Do not forget to add and push this file as well, as it will be
required for your post to be successfully integrated.




## Contributing slides

Material for slides is stored in `static/slides`. Currently, two files are needed for a lecture:

1. a `.Rmd` post in `content/post` (see above) to introduce the lecture and link
to the slides; for an example, look at
`content/post/lecture-reproducibility.Rmd`.

2. the slides themselves, stored in `static/slides`.

For the slides, we recommended using `.Rmd` there again, and rendering them before committing them. If your slides use images, store them in
`static/img/slides`. You will be able to refer to them using
`../../img/slides/your-image.jpg`. For an example of `rmarkdown+ioslides`
slides, look at
`static/slides/intro_reproducibility_Rmd/intro_reproducibility.Rmd`.



## Other topics 
### Contributing top-level pages
To contribute a page that sits outside of the posts category you can make an `.md` file (or a `.Rmd` file so long as you render to `.md` too). This will then be processed by Hugo along with the other files to build the website.

These files should have at minimum:

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
date : 2017-11-01
title : About RECON learn
---
```

### Maintaining package dependencies
This repository also has a DESCRIPTION which lists any packages required to build all of the `.Rmd` files in `content/post/`. Keep it up to date with `R/get_and_update_dependencies.R`. You will need `tidyverse` and `devtools` installed for the script to run.

### Getting the dependencies
If you need to install the dependencies locally, you can use `devtools::install()` in the console to fetch all the dependencies.

### Editing existing content
If you need to change an existing piece of content:
1. Delete its corresponding `.md` file
2. Make the changes to the `.Rmd` file
3. Run `R/render_new_rmds_to_md.R`
4. Commit and push to the repository
